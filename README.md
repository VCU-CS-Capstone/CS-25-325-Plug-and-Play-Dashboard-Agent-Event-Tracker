# CS-25-325 Plug and Play Clickstream Dashboard and Agent Event Tracker
## Capital One
## *Short Project Description*
Capstone group CS-25-325 will build a website or get existing data from an already built website that tracks clickstream events, select a data storage and analysis platform (e.g., AWS, Tableau), research data visualization tools, and create reusable dashboards for stakeholders to easily view and analyze data with minimal technical input. These dashboards will allow stakeholders to input key data, such as feature names, and receive insightful visualizations, facilitating informed decision-making.
